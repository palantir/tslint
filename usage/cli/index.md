### Installation

__Local__ (in your project's working directory):

```sh
npm install tslint typescript --save-dev
# or
yarn add tslint typescript --dev
```

__Global__:

```sh
npm install tslint typescript -g
# or
yarn global add tslint typescript
```

{% include peer_dependencies.md %}

### CLI Usage

Please ensure that the TypeScript source files compile correctly _before_ running the linter.

Usage: `tslint [options] [file ...]`

Options:

```
-c, --config          configuration file
-e, --exclude         exclude globs from path expansion
--fix                 Fixes linting errors for select rules. This may overwrite linted files
--force               return status code 0 even if there are lint errors
-h, --help            display detailed help
-i, --init            generate a tslint.json config file in the current working directory
-o, --out             output file
--outputAbsolutePaths whether or not outputted file paths are absolute
-p, --project         tsconfig.json file
-r, --rules-dir       rules directory
-s, --formatters-dir  formatters directory
-t, --format          output format (prose, json, stylish, verbose, pmd, msbuild, checkstyle, vso, fileslist, codeFrame)  [default: "prose"]
--test                test that tslint produces the correct output for the specified directory
--type-check          (deprecated) enable type checking when linting a project
-v, --version         current version
```

By default, TSLint looks for a configuration file named `tslint.json` in the directory
of the file being linted and, if not found, searches ancestor directories. Check out the [rules][0] section for more details on what rules are available.

tslint accepts the following command-line options:

```
-c, --config:
    The location of the configuration file that tslint will use to
    determine which rules are activated and what options to provide
    to the rules. If no option is specified, the config file named
    tslint.json is used, so long as it exists in the path.
    The format of the file is { rules: { /* rules list */ } },
    where /* rules list */ is a key: value comma-separated list of
    rulename: rule-options pairs. Rule-options can be either a
    boolean true/false value denoting whether the rule is used or not,
    or a list [boolean, ...] where the boolean provides the same role
    as in the non-list case, and the rest of the list are options passed
    to the rule that will determine what it checks for (such as number
    of characters for the max-line-length rule, or what functions to ban
    for the ban rule).

-e, --exclude:
    A filename or glob which indicates files to exclude from linting.
    This option can be supplied multiple times if you need multiple
    globs to indicate which files to exclude.

--fix:
    Fixes linting errors for select rules. This may overwrite linted files.

--force:
    Return status code 0 even if there are any lint errors.
    Useful while running as npm script.

-i, --init:
    Generates a tslint.json config file in the current working directory.

-o, --out:
    A filename to output the results to. By default, tslint outputs to
    stdout, which is usually the console where you're running it from.

--outputAbsolutePaths:
    Indicates whether or not outputted file paths are absolute paths.

-r, --rules-dir:
    An additional rules directory, for user-created rules.
    tslint will always check its default rules directory, in
    node_modules/tslint/lib/rules, before checking the user-provided
    rules directory, so rules in the user-provided rules directory
    with the same name as the base rules will not be loaded.

-s, --formatters-dir:
    An additional formatters directory, for user-created formatters.
    Formatters are files that will format the tslint output, before
    writing it to stdout or the file passed in --out. The default
    directory, node_modules/tslint/build/formatters, will always be
    checked first, so user-created formatters with the same names
    as the base formatters will not be loaded.

-t, --format:
    The formatter to use to format the results of the linter before
    outputting it to stdout or the file passed in --out. The core
    formatters are prose (human readable), json (machine readable)
    and verbose. prose is the default if this option is not used.
    Other built-in options include pmd, msbuild, checkstyle, and vso.
    Additonal formatters can be added and used if the --formatters-dir
    option is set.

--test:
    Runs tslint on the specified directory and checks if tslint's output matches
    the expected output in .lint files. Automatically loads the tslint.json file in the
    specified directory as the configuration file for the tests. See the
    full tslint documentation for more details on how this can be used to test custom rules.

-p, --project:
    The location of a tsconfig.json file that will be used to determine which
    files will be linted.

--type-check
    (deprecated) Enables the type checker when running linting rules.
    --project must be specified in order to enable type checking.

-v, --version:
    The current version of tslint.

-h, --help:
    Prints this help message.
```

#### Exit Codes

The CLI process may exit with the following codes:

- `0`: Linting succeeded without errors (warnings may have ocurred)
- `1`: An invalid command line argument or combination thereof was used
- `2`: Linting failed with one or more rule violations with severity `error`

[0]: {{site.baseurl | append: "/rules/"}}
