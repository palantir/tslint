### Rule Suggestion

_Note: TSLint has stopped accepting new core rules because it is being deprecated in favor of ESLint. Your request is likely to be rejected with the suggestion to maintain a custom rule outside this repository. See [the roadmap](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/issues/4534) for more details._

**Is your rule for a general problem or is it specific to your development style?**

**What does your suggested rule do?**

**List several examples where your rule could be used**
