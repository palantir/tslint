ruleName: no-for-in-array
description: Disallows iterating over an array with a for-in loop.
descriptionDetails: |

  A for-in loop (`for (var k in o)`) iterates over the properties of an Object.

  While it is legal to use for-in loops with array types, it is not common.
  for-in will iterate over the indices of the array as strings, omitting any "holes" in
  the array.

  More common is to use for-of, which iterates over the values of an array.
  If you want to iterate over the indices, alternatives include:

  array.forEach((value, index) => { ... });
  for (const [index, value] of array.entries()) { ... }
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { ... }
