ruleName: no-bitwise
description: Disallows bitwise operators.
descriptionDetails: |-

  Specifically, the following bitwise operators are banned:
  `&`, `&=`, `|`, `|=`,
  `^`, `^=`, `<<`, `<<=`,
  `>>`, `>>=`, `>>>`, `>>>=`, and `~`.
  This rule does not ban the use of `&` and `|` for intersection and union types.
rationale: |-

  Bitwise operators are often typos - for example `bool1 & bool2` instead of `bool1 && bool2`.
  They also can be an indicator of overly clever code which decreases maintainability.
