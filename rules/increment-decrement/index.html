description: Enforces using explicit += 1 or -= 1 operators.
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
  - '[true, "allow-post"]'
options:
  items:
    enum:
      - allow-post
    type: string
  maxLength: 1
  minLength: 0
  type: array
optionsDescription: |-

  If no arguments are provided, both pre- and post-unary operators are banned.
  If `"allow-post"` is provided, post-unary operators will be allowed.
          
rationale: |-

  It's easy to type +i or -i instead of --i or ++i, and won't always result in invalid code.
  Prefer standardizing small arithmetic operations with the explicit += and -= operators.
