ruleName: no-restricted-globals
description: Disallow specific global variables.
rationale: |-

  ```ts
  function broken(evt: Event) {
      // Meant to do something with `evt` but typed it incorrectly.
      Event.target;  // compiler error
      event.target;  // should be a lint failure
  }

  Early Internet Explorer versions exposed the current DOM event as a global variable 'event',
  but using this variable has been considered a bad practice for a long time.
  Restricting this will make sure this variable isnâ€™t used in browser code.
  ```
          
descriptionDetails: |-

  Disallowing usage of specific global variables can be useful if you want to allow
  a set of global variables by enabling an environment, but still want to disallow
  some of those.
