ruleName: await-promise
description: Warns for an awaited value that is not a Promise.
optionsDescription: |-

  A list of 'string' names of any additional classes that should also be treated as Promises.
  For example, if you are using a class called 'Future' that implements the Thenable interface,
  you might tell the rule to consider type references with the name 'Future' as valid Promise-like
  types. Note that this rule doesn't check for type assignability or compatibility; it just checks
  type reference names.
          
options:
  type: list
  listType:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
  - '[true, "Thenable"]'
rationale: |-

  While it is valid JavaScript to await a non-Promise-like value (it will resolve immediately),
  this pattern is often a programmer error and the resulting semantics can be unintuitive.

  Awaiting non-Promise-like values often is an indication of programmer error, such as
  forgetting to add parenthesis to call a function that returns a Promise.
