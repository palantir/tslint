ruleName: class-name
description: Enforces PascalCased class and interface names.
rationale: |-

  Makes it easy to differentiate classes from regular variables at a glance.

  JavaScript and general programming convention is to refer to classes in PascalCase.
  It's confusing to use camelCase or other conventions for class names.
