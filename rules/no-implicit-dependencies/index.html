descriptionDetails: |-

  Disallows importing transient dependencies and modules installed above your package's root directory.
          
optionsDescription: |-

  By default the rule looks at `"dependencies"` and `"peerDependencies"`.
  By adding the `"dev"` option the rule also looks at `"devDependencies"`.
  By adding the `"optional"` option the rule also looks at `"optionalDependencies"`.
  An array of whitelisted modules can be added to skip checking their existence in package.json.
          
options:
  type: array
  items:
    - type: string
      enum:
        - dev
        - optional
    - type: array
  minItems: 0
  maxItems: 3

  - 'true'
  - '[true, "dev"]'
  - '[true, "optional"]'
  - '[true, ["src", "app"]]'
