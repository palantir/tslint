description: Bans usage of the delete operator with computed key expressions.
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
options: null
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
rationale: |-

  Deleting dynamically computed keys is dangerous and not well optimized.

  Also consider using a [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)
  or [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set)
  if you're storing collections of objects.
  Using `Object`s can cause occasional edge case bugs, such as if a key is named "hasOwnProperty".
