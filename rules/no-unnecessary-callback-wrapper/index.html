ruleName: no-unnecessary-callback-wrapper
description: |-

  Replaces `x => f(x)` with just `f`.
  To catch more cases, enable `only-arrow-functions` and `arrow-return-shorthand` too.
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
options: null
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
rationale: |-

  There's generally no reason to wrap a function with a callback wrapper if it's directly called anyway.
  Doing so creates extra inline lambdas that slow the runtime down.
