ruleName: no-angle-bracket-type-assertion
description: 'Requires the use of `as Type` for type assertions instead of `<Type>`.'
rationale: |-

  Both formats of type assertions have the same effect, but only `as` type assertions
  work in `.tsx` files. This rule ensures that you have a consistent type assertion style
  across your codebase.
