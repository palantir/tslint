description: Disallows one or more blank lines in a row.
hasFix: true
rationale: |-

  Helps maintain a readable style in your codebase.

  Extra blank lines take up extra space and add little to a semantic understanding of the code.
  It can be harder to read through files when fewer components can fit into the screen.
  If you find a file is so large you feel a need to split them up with extra blank lines or comments,
  consider splitting your file into smaller files.
