ruleName: no-floating-promises
description: Promises returned by functions must be handled appropriately.
descriptionDetails: 'Unhandled Promises can cause unexpected behavior, such as resolving at unexpected times.'
optionsDescription: |-

  A list of 'string' names of any additional classes that should also be handled as Promises.
          
options:
  type: list
  listType:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
  - '[true, "JQueryPromise"]'
rationale: |-

  Creating a Promise and not storing or returning may lets other code run independent of of its results.
  This can cause unexpected and/or non-deterministic behavior depending on external timing factors.

  It's typically better to return Promises from functions that start them, then handle them in calling code.

  Use `no-unused-expression` in addition to this rule to reveal even more floating promises.
