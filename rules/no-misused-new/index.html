ruleName: no-misused-new
description: Warns on apparent attempts to define constructors for interfaces or `new` for classes.
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
options: null
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
rationale: |-

  Interfaces in TypeScript aren't meant to describe constructors on their implementations.
  The `new` descriptor is primarily for describing JavaScript libraries.
  If you're trying to describe a function known to be a class, it's typically better to `declare class`.
