ruleName: no-var-requires
description: Disallows the use of require statements except in import statements.
descriptionDetails: |-

  In other words, the use of forms such as `var module = require("module")` are banned.
  Instead use ES2015-style imports or `import foo = require('foo')` imports.
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
options: null
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
rationale: |-

  AMD-style `require([])` and CommonJS-style `require("")` statements are environment-specific
  and more difficult to statically analyze.

  ES2015-style `import`s are part of the JavaScript language specfication and recommended as the path going forward.
  TypeScript will compile them to environment-specific forms as needed.
