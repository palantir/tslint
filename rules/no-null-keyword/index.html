ruleName: no-null-keyword
description: Disallows use of the `null` keyword literal.
rationale: |-

  Instead of having the dual concepts of `null` and`undefined` in a codebase,
  this rule ensures that only `undefined` is used.

  JavaScript originally intended `undefined` to refer to a value that doesn't yet exist,
  while `null` was meant to refer to a value that does exist but points to nothing.
  That's confusing.
  `undefined` is the default value when object members don't exist, and is the return value
  for newer native collection APIs such as `Map.get` when collection values don't exist.

  ```
  const myObject = {};
  myObject.doesNotExist; // undefined
  ```

  ```
  const myMap = new Map<string, number>();
  myMap.get("doesNotExist"); // undefined
  ```

  To remove confusion over the two similar values, it's better to stick with just `undefined`.
