ruleName: no-void-expression
description: Requires expressions of type `void` to appear in statement position.
optionsDescription: |-

  If `ignore-arrow-function-shorthand` is provided, `() => returnsVoid()` will be allowed.
  Otherwise, it must be written as `() => { returnsVoid(); }`.
options:
  type: array
  items:
    type: string
    enum:
      - ignore-arrow-function-shorthand
  minLength: 0
  maxLength: 1
rationale: |-

  It's misleading returning the results of an expression whose type is `void`.
  Attempting to do so is likely a symptom of expecting a different return type from a function.
  For example, the following code will log `undefined` but looks like it logs a value:

  ```
  const performWork = (): void => {
      workFirst();
      workSecond();
  };

  console.log(performWork());
  ```
