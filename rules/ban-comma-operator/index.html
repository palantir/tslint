ruleName: ban-comma-operator
description: Disallows the comma operator to be used.
descriptionDetails: '[Read more about the comma operator here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comma_Operator).'
rationale: |-

  Using the comma operator can create a potential for many non-obvious bugs or lead to misunderstanding of code.

  ### Examples
  ```
  foo((bar, baz)); // evaluates to 'foo(baz)' because of the extra parens - confusing and not obvious
  ```

  ```
  switch (foo) {
      case 1, 2: // equals 'case 2' - probably intended 'case 1: case2:'
          return true;
      case 3:
          return false;
  }
  ```

  ```
  let x = (y = 1, z = 2); // x is equal to 2 - this may not be immediately obvious.
  ```
