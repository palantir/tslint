ruleName: object-literal-key-quotes
description: Enforces consistent object literal property quote style.
descriptionDetails: |-

  Object literal property names can be defined in two ways: using literals or using strings.
  For example, these two objects are equivalent:

  var object1 = {
      property: true
  };

  var object2 = {
      "property": true
  };

  In many cases, it doesn’t matter if you choose to use an identifier instead of a string
  or vice-versa. Even so, you might decide to enforce a consistent style in your code.

  This rules lets you enforce consistent quoting of property names. Either they should always
  be quoted (default behavior) or quoted only as needed ("as-needed").
hasFix: true
optionsDescription: |-

  Possible settings are:

  * `"always"`: Property names should always be quoted. (This is the default.)
  * `"as-needed"`: Only property names which require quotes may be quoted (e.g. those with spaces in them).
  * `"consistent"`: Property names should either all be quoted or unquoted.
  * `"consistent-as-needed"`: If any property name requires quotes, then all properties must be quoted. Otherwise, no
  property names may be quoted.

  For ES6, computed property names (`{[name]: value}`) and methods (`{foo() {}}`) never need
  to be quoted.
