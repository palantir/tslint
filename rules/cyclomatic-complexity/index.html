description: Enforces a threshold of cyclomatic complexity.
descriptionDetails: |-

  Cyclomatic complexity is assessed for each function of any type. A starting value of 0
  is assigned and this value is then incremented for every statement which can branch the
  control flow within the function. The following statements and expressions contribute
  to cyclomatic complexity:
  * `catch`
  * `if` and `? :`
  * `||` and `&&` due to short-circuit evaluation
  * `for`, `for in` and `for of` loops
  * `while` and `do while` loops
  * `case` clauses that contain statements
rationale: |-

  Cyclomatic complexity is a code metric which indicates the level of complexity in a
  function. High cyclomatic complexity indicates confusing code which may be prone to
  errors or difficult to modify.

  It's better to have smaller, single-purpose functions with self-documenting names.
optionsDescription: |-

  An optional upper limit for cyclomatic complexity can be specified. If no limit option
  is provided a default value of 20 will be used.
