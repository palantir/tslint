ruleName: object-literal-sort-keys
description: Checks ordering of keys in object literals.
rationale: Useful in preventing merge conflicts
optionsDescription: |

  By default, this rule checks that keys are in alphabetical order.
  The following may optionally be passed:

  * "ignore-case" will to compare keys in a case insensitive way.
  * "match-declaration-order will prefer to use the key ordering of the contextual type of the object literal, as in:

      interface I { foo: number; bar: number; }
      const obj: I = { foo: 1, bar: 2 };

  If a contextual type is not found, alphabetical ordering will be used instead.
options:
  type: string
  enum:
    - ignore-case
    - match-declaration-order
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
  - '[true, "ignore-case", "match-declaration-order"]'
