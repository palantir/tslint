ruleName: no-unused-variable
description: |-

  Disallows unused imports, variables, functions and
  private class members. Similar to tsc's --noUnusedParameters and --noUnusedLocals
  options, but does not interrupt code compilation.
descriptionDetails: |-

  In addition to avoiding compilation errors, this rule may still be useful if you
  wish to have `tslint` automatically remove unused imports, variables, functions,
  and private class members, when using TSLint's `--fix` option.
hasFix: true
optionsDescription: |-

  Three optional arguments may be optionally provided:

  * `"check-parameters"` disallows unused function and constructor parameters.
      * NOTE: this option is experimental and does not work with classes
      that use abstract method declarations, among other things.
  * `{"ignore-pattern": "pattern"}` where pattern is a case-sensitive regexp.
  Variable names and imports that match the pattern will be ignored.
options:
  type: array
  items:
    oneOf:
      - type: string
        enum:
          - check-parameters
      - type: object
        properties:
          ignore-pattern:
            type: string
        additionalProperties: false
  minLength: 0
  maxLength: 3
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
  - '[true, {"ignore-pattern": "^_"}]'
rationale: |-

  Variables that are declared and not used anywhere in code are likely an error due to incomplete refactoring.
  Such variables take up space in the code, are mild performance pains, and can lead to confusion by readers.
