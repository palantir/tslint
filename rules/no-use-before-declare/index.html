ruleName: no-use-before-declare
description: Disallows usage of variables before their declaration.
descriptionDetails: |-

  This rule is primarily useful when using the `var` keyword since the compiler will
  automatically detect if a block-scoped `let` and `const` variable is used before
  declaration. Since most modern TypeScript doesn't use `var`, this rule is generally
  discouraged and is kept around for legacy purposes. It is slow to compute, is not
  enabled in the built-in configuration presets, and should not be used to inform TSLint
  design decisions.
