ruleName: no-var-keyword
description: Disallows usage of the `var` keyword.
descriptionDetails: Use `let` or `const` instead.
hasFix: true
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
options: null
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
rationale: |-

  Declaring variables using `var` has several edge case behaviors that make `var` unsuitable for modern code.
  Variables declared by `var` have their parent function block as their scope, ignoring other control flow statements.
  `var`s have declaration "hoisting" (similar to `function`s) and can appear to be used before declaration.

  Variables declared by `const` and `let` instead have as their scope the block in which they are defined,
  and are not allowed to used before declaration or be re-declared with another `const` or `let`.
