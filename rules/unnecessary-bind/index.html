description: Prevents unnecessary and/or misleading scope bindings on functions.
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
options: null
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
rationale: |-

  `function` expressions that are immediately bound to `this` are equivalent to `() =>` arrow lambdas.
  Additionally, there's no use in binding a scope to an arrow lambda, as it already has one.
