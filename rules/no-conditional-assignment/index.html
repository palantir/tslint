ruleName: no-conditional-assignment
description: Disallows any type of assignment in conditionals.
descriptionDetails: 'This applies to `do-while`, `for`, `if`, and `while` statements and conditional (ternary) expressions.'
rationale: |-

  Assignments in conditionals are often typos:
  for example `if (var1 = var2)` instead of `if (var1 == var2)`.
  They also can be an indicator of overly clever code which decreases maintainability.
