ruleName: jsdoc-format
description: Enforces basic format rules for JSDoc comments.
descriptionDetails: |-

  The following rules are enforced for JSDoc comments (comments starting with `/**`):

  * each line contains an asterisk and asterisks must be aligned
  * each asterisk must be followed by either a space or a newline (except for the first and the last)
  * the only characters before the asterisk on each line must be whitespace characters
  * one line comments must start with `/** ` and end with `*/`
  * multiline comments don't allow text after `/** ` in the first line (with option `"check-multiline-start"`)
          
rationale: 'Helps maintain a consistent, readable style for JSDoc comments.'
optionsDescription: |-

  You can optionally specify the option `"check-multiline-start"` to enforce the first line of a
  multiline JSDoc comment to be empty.
