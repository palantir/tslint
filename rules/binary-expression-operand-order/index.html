ruleName: binary-expression-operand-order
description: |-

  In a binary expression, a literal should always be on the right-hand side if possible.
  For example, prefer 'x + 1' over '1 + x'.
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
options: null
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
rationale: |-

  Expressions like `1 + x` are sometimes referred to as "Yoda" expressions because they read
  opposite to how we would normally speak the expression.

  Sticking to a consistent grammar for conditions helps keep code readable and understandable.
