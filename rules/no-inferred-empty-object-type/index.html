ruleName: no-inferred-empty-object-type
description: 'Disallow type inference of {} (empty object type) at function and constructor call sites'
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
options: null
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
rationale: |-

  When function or constructor may be called with a type parameter but one isn't supplied or inferrable,
  TypeScript defaults to `{}`.
  This is often undesirable as the call is meant to be of a more specific type.
