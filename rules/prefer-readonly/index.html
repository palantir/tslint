description: Requires that private variables are marked as `readonly` if they're never modified outside of the constructor.
descriptionDetails: |-

  If a private variable is only assigned to in the constructor, it should be declared as `readonly`.
          
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
  - '[true, "only-inline-lambdas"]'
options:
  enum:
    - only-inline-lambdas
  type: string
optionsDescription: |-

  If `only-inline-lambdas` is specified, only immediately-declared arrow functions are checked.
rationale: |-

  Marking never-modified variables as readonly helps enforce the code's intent of keeping them as never-modified.
  It can also help prevent accidental changes of members not meant to be changed.
