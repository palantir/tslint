ruleName: member-ordering
description: Enforces member ordering.
hasFix: true
rationale: |-

  A consistent ordering for class members can make classes easier to read, navigate, and edit.

  A common opposite practice to `member-ordering` is to keep related groups of classes together.
  Instead of creating classes with multiple separate groups, consider splitting class responsibilities
  apart across multiple single-responsibility classes.
          
optionsDescription: |-

  One argument, which is an object, must be provided. It should contain an `order` property.
  The `order` property should have a value of one of the following strings:

  * `fields-first`
  * `instance-sandwich`
  * `statics-first`

  `fields-first` puts, in order of precedence:
      * fields before constructors before methods
      * static members before instance members
      * public members before protected members before private members
  `instance-sandwich` puts, in order of precedence:
      * fields before constructors before methods
      * static fields before instance fields, but static methods *after* instance methods
      * public members before protected members before private members
  `statics-first` puts, in order of precedence:
      * static members before instance members
          * public members before protected members before private members
          * fields before methods
      * instance fields before constructors before instance methods
          * fields before constructors before methods
          * public members before protected members before private members
  Note that these presets, despite looking similar, can have subtly different behavior due to the order in which these
  rules are specified. A fully expanded ordering can be found in the PRESETS constant in
  https://github.com/palantir/tslint/blob/master/src/rules/memberOrderingRule.ts.
  (You may need to check the version of the file corresponding to your version of tslint.)

  Alternatively, the value for `order` may be an array consisting of the following strings:

  * `public-static-field`
  * `protected-static-field`
  * `private-static-field`
  * `public-static-method`
  * `private-static-method`
  * `protected-static-method`
  * `public-instance-field`
  * `protected-instance-field`
  * `private-instance-field`
  * `public-constructor`
  * `protected-constructor`
  * `private-constructor`
  * `public-instance-method`
  * `protected-instance-method`
  * `private-instance-method`
  * `public-static-accessor`
  * `protected-static-accessor`
  * `private-static-accessor`
  * `public-instance-accessor`
  * `protected-instance-accessor`
  * `private-instance-accessor`

  You can also omit the access modifier to refer to "public-", "protected-", and "private-" all at once; for example, "static-field".

  You can also make your own categories by using an object instead of a string:

      {
          "name": "static non-private",
          "kinds": [
              "public-static-field",
              "protected-static-field",
              "public-static-method",
              "protected-static-method"
          ]
      }

  The 'alphabetize' option will enforce that members within the same category should be alphabetically sorted by name.
  Computed property names are sorted before others but not sorted amongst each other.
  Additionally getters will be sorted before setters (after alphabetization).
