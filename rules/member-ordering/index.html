ruleName: member-ordering
description: Enforces member ordering.
hasFix: true
rationale: |-

  A consistent ordering for class members can make classes easier to read, navigate, and edit.

  A common opposite practice to `member-ordering` is to keep related groups of classes together.
  Instead of creating classes with multiple separate groups, consider splitting class responsibilities
  apart across multiple single-responsibility classes.
          
optionsDescription: |-

  One argument, which is an object, must be provided. It should contain an `order` property.
  The `order` property should have a value of one of the following strings:

  * `fields-first`
  * `instance-sandwich`
  * `statics-first`

  `fields-first` puts, in order of precedence:

      * fields before constructors before methods
      * static members before instance members
      * public members before protected members before private members

  `instance-sandwich` puts, in order of precedence:

      * fields before constructors before methods
      * static fields before instance fields, but static methods *after* instance methods
      * public members before protected members before private members

  `statics-first` puts, in order of precedence:

      * static members before instance members
          * public members before protected members before private members
          * fields before methods
      * instance fields before constructors before instance methods
          * fields before constructors before methods
          * public members before protected members before private members

  Note that these presets, despite looking similar, can have subtly different behavior due to the order in which these
  rules are specified. A fully expanded ordering can be found in the PRESETS constant in
  https://github.com/palantir/tslint/blob/master/src/rules/memberOrderingRule.ts.
  (You may need to check the version of the file corresponding to your version of tslint.)

  Alternatively, the value for `order` may be an array consisting of the following strings:

  * `public-static-field`
  * `public-static-method`
  * `protected-static-field`
  * `protected-static-method`
  * `private-static-field`
  * `private-static-method`
  * `public-instance-field`
  * `protected-instance-field`
  * `private-instance-field`
  * `public-constructor`
  * `protected-constructor`
  * `private-constructor`
  * `public-instance-method`
  * `protected-instance-method`
  * `private-instance-method`

  You can also omit the access modifier to refer to "public-", "protected-", and "private-" all at once; for example, "static-field".

  You can also make your own categories by using an object instead of a string:

      {
          "name": "static non-private",
          "kinds": [
              "public-static-field",
              "protected-static-field",
              "public-static-method",
              "protected-static-method"
          ]
      }

  The 'alphabetize' option will enforce that members within the same category should be alphabetically sorted by name.
