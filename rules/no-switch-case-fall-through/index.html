ruleName: no-switch-case-fall-through
description: Disallows falling through case statements.
descriptionDetails: |-

  For example, the following is not allowed:

  ```ts
  switch(foo) {
      case 1:
          someFunc(foo);
      case 2:
          someOtherFunc(foo);
  }
  ```

  However, fall through is allowed when case statements are consecutive or
  a magic `/* falls through */` comment is present. The following is valid:

  ```ts
  switch(foo) {
      case 1:
          someFunc(foo);
          /* falls through */
      case 2:
      case 3:
          someOtherFunc(foo);
  }
  ```
rationale: Fall though in switch statements is often unintentional and a bug.
