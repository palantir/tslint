ruleName: no-unsafe-finally
description: |-

  Disallows control flow statements, such as `return`, `continue`,
  `break` and `throws` in finally blocks.
descriptionDetails: ''
rationale: |-

  When used inside `finally` blocks, control flow statements,
  such as `return`, `continue`, `break` and `throws`
  override any other control flow statements in the same try/catch scope.
  This is confusing and unexpected behavior.
