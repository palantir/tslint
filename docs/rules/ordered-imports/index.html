ruleName: ordered-imports
description: Requires that import statements be alphabetized.
descriptionDetails: |-

  Enforce a consistent ordering for ES6 imports:
  - Named imports must be alphabetized (i.e. "import {A, B, C} from "foo";")
      - The exact ordering can be controled by the named-imports-order option.
      - "longName as name" imports are ordered by "longName".
  - Import sources must be alphabetized within groups, i.e.:
          import * as foo from "a";
          import * as bar from "b";
  - Groups of imports are delineated by blank lines. You can use these to group imports
      however you like, e.g. by first- vs. third-party or thematically.
optionsDescription: |-

  You may set the `"named-imports-order"` option to control the ordering of named
  imports (the `{A, B, C}` in 'import {A, B, C} from "foo"`.)

  Possible values for `"named-imports-order"` are:

  * `"case-insensitive'`: Correct order is `{A, b, C}`. (This is the default.)
  * `"lowercase-first"`: Correct order is `{b, A, C}`.
  * `"lowercase-last"`: Correct order is `{A, C, b}`.
