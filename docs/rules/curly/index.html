ruleName: curly
description: Enforces braces for `if`/`for`/`do`/`while` statements.
rationale: |-

  ```ts
  if (foo === bar)
      foo++;
      bar++;
  ```

  In the code above, the author almost certainly meant for both `foo++` and `bar++`
  to be executed only if `foo === bar`. However, he forgot braces and `bar++` will be executed
  no matter what. This rule could prevent such a mistake.
optionsDescription: |

  The rule may be set to `true`, or to any combination of these arguments:

  * `"all"` requires braces for all control-flow statements
  * `"same-line-single-line"` requires braces for control-flow statements
    that are on one line and start on the same line as their control-flow keyword
  * `"same-line-multi-line"` requires braces for control-flow statements
    that are split between multiple lines and start on the same line as their control-flow keyword
  * `"next-line-single-line"` requires braces for control-flow statements
    that are on one line and start on the line after their control-flow keyword
  * `"next-line-multi-line"` requires braces for control-flow statements
    that are split between multiple lines and start on the line after their control-flow keyword
options:
  type: array
  items:
    type: string
    enum:
      - all
      - same-line-single-line
      - same-line-multi-line
      - next-line-single-line
      - next-line-multi-line
optionExamples:
  - 'true'
  - '[true, "same-line-single-line"]'
