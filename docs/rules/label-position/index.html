ruleName: label-position
description: Only allows labels in sensible locations.
descriptionDetails: This rule only allows labels to be on `do/for/while/switch` statements.
rationale: |-

  Labels in JavaScript only can be used in conjunction with `break` or `continue`,
  constructs meant to be used for loop flow control. While you can theoretically use
  labels on any block statement in JS, it is considered poor code structure to do so.
