ruleName: no-construct
description: 'Disallows access to the constructors of `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean`.'
descriptionDetails: Disallows constructor use such as `new Number(foo)` but does not disallow `Number(foo)`.
rationale: |-

  There is little reason to use `String`, `Number`, or `Boolean` as constructors.
  In almost all cases, the regular function-call version is more appropriate.
