description: Enforces basic format rules for JSDoc comments.
descriptionDetails: |-

  The following rules are enforced for JSDoc comments (comments starting with `/**`):

  * each line contains an asterisk and asterisks must be aligned
  * each asterisk must be followed by either a space or a newline (except for the first and the last)
  * the only characters before the asterisk on each line must be whitespace characters
  * one line comments must start with `/** ` and end with `*/`
rationale: 'Helps maintain a consistent, readable style for JSDoc comments.'
