ruleName: no-conditional-assignment
description: Disallows any type of assignment in conditionals.
descriptionDetails: 'This applies to `do-while`, `for`, `if`, and `while` statements.'

  Assignments in conditionals are often typos:

  They also can be an indicator of overly clever code which decreases maintainability.
