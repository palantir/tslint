tslint accepts the following commandline options:

    -f, --file:
        The location of the TypeScript file that you wish to lint. This
        option is required.

    -c, --config:
        The location of the configuration file that tslint will use to
        determine which rules are activated and what options to provide
        to the rules. If no option is specified, the config file named
        tslint.json is used, so long as it exists in the path.
        The format of the file is { rules: { /* rules list */ } },
        where /* rules list */ is a key: value comma-seperated list of
        rulename: rule-options pairs. Rule-options can be either a
        boolean true/false value denoting whether the rule is used or not,
        or a list [boolean, ...] where the boolean provides the same role
        as in the non-list case, and the rest of the list are options passed
        to the rule that will determine what it checks for (such as number
        of characters for the max-line-length rule, or what functions to ban
        for the ban rule).

    -o, --out:
        A filename to output the results to. By default, tslint outputs to
        stdout, which is usually the console where you're running it from.

    -r, --rules-dir:
        An additional rules directory, for user-created rules.
        tslint will always check its default rules directory, in
        node_modules/tslint/build/rules, before checking the user-provided
        rules directory, so rules in the user-provided rules directory
        with the same name as the base rules will not be loaded.

    -s, --formatters-dir:
        An additional formatters directory, for user-created formatters.
        Formatters are files that will format the tslint output, before
        writing it to stdout or the file passed in --out. The default
        directory, node_modules/tslint/build/formatters, will always be
        checked first, so user-created formatters with the same names
        as the base formatters will not be loaded.

    -t, --format:
        The formatter to use to format the results of the linter before
        outputting it to stdout or the file passed in --out. The core
        formatters are prose (human readable) and json (machine readable),
        and prose is the default if this option is not used. Additonal
        formatters can be added and used if the --formatters-dir option
        is set.
