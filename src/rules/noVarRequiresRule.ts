            In other words, the use of forms such as \`var module = require("module")\` are banned.
            Instead use ES2015-style imports or \`import foo = require('foo')\` imports.`,

        rationale: Lint.Utils.dedent`
            AMD-style \`require([])\` and CommonJS-style \`require("")\` statements are environment-specific
            and more difficult to statically analyze.

            ES2015-style \`import\`s are part of the JavaScript language specfication and recommended as the path going forward.
            TypeScript will compile them to environment-specific forms as needed.
